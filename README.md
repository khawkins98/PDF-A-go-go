# PDF-A-go-go

PDF-A-go-go is a super simple, embeddable PDF viewer project. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into your own applications.

This project is heavily based on the following open-source projects:

- [flipbook-viewer](https://github.com/theproductiveprogrammer/flipbook-viewer/)
- [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)

> Note: The flipbook-viewer has been lightly forked in this project to support navigating directly to specific pages and searching within the PDF.

## Development

To set up a local development environment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
2. Start the local server:
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5000) to view `dist/index.html`.
