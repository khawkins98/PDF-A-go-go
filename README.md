PDF-A-go-go is a super simple, embeddable PDF viewer project. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into your own applications.

## Future plans

This project is very fresh (rolled on 6 May 2025). I may yet publish to npm or change it completely.

## Usage

Include the JS and CSS in your HTML, and add a container:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="pdf-a-go-go.css">
<script src="pdf-a-go-go.js"></script>
<div class="pdfagogo-container" id="pdfagogo-container"></div>
```

Set options before loading:

```js
window.PDFaGoGoOptions = {
  showPrevNext: true,      // Show previous/next page buttons (default: true)
  showPageSelector: true,  // Show page selector input (default: true)
  showCurrentPage: true,   // Show current page indicator (default: true)
  showSearch: true,        // Show search controls (default: true)
  showDownload: true,      // Show a Download PDF button
  pdfUrl: "https://example.com/your.pdf", // PDF URL to load (default: sample PDF)
  defaultPage: 3,              // (NEW) Default page to open if no #page=N in URL (1-based)
};
```

## Development

PDF-A-go-go is a simple, embeddable PDF viewer project. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into your own applications.

This project is heavily based on the following open-source projects:

- [flipbook-viewer](https://github.com/theproductiveprogrammer/flipbook-viewer/)
- [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)

> Note: The flipbook-viewer has been forked in this project to support navigating directly to specific pages and searching within the PDF.

## Page spread (Two-page/single-spread) support

PDF-A-go-go supports both traditional single-page and two-page spread ("spread mode") PDFs, including those where each PDF page is already a two-page spread image.

### Features
- **Autodetection:**
  - The viewer will automatically detect if a PDF is in spread mode by checking the aspect ratio of the first (or second) page. If the page is much wider than it is tall, spread mode is enabled.
- **Manual Override:**
  - You can force spread mode on or off by passing the `spreadMode` option:
    ```js
    PDFaGoGoOptions = { spreadMode: true };
    ```
- **UI Toggle:**
  - A "Spread Mode" checkbox is available in the viewer controls, allowing users to switch between normal and spread mode at any time. The viewer will attempt to keep you on the same logical page when toggling.
- **First/Last Page Handling:**
  - In spread mode, if the first or last page is a single (not double) spread, it will be centered and shown at its natural aspect ratio, not stretched.

### Open to a Specific Page

You can open the viewer to a specific page by adding `#page=N` to the URL (e.g. `#page=5`).
This will override the `defaultPage` option if both are present.
